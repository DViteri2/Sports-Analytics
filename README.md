# Sports Analytics at a Glance

This repository contains multiple projects focused on applying machine learning techniques to analyze and predict outcomes in various sports. 

## Overview

### Baseball Swing Probability Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict the probability of a swing for all pitches in season 3.
- **Approach**: Train machine learning models on pitch-related features to predict swing/no-swing outcomes.
- **Techniques**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.), evaluation using ROC AUC and confusion matrix.

### Football Gain Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict the GAIN values (yards gained) in football plays.
- **Approach**: Use regression models to analyze football game data and predict yards gained.
- **Techniques**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.), evaluation using accuracy and ROC AUC.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean datasets, handle missing values, encode categorical variables.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Select and create relevant features for model training.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate models using appropriate metrics.
4. **Prediction and Analysis**: Make predictions and analyze results for insights.
